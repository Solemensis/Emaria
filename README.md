# [Web App] Emaria
Fully functional responsive general e-commerce website - https://emaria.vercel.app/
 

Techs used: Vue3, Nuxt3, Pinia, Supabase, directus, Formkit, VueUse, Aos.
- [Vue3 & Nuxt3] as building blocks.
- [Pinia] to maintain cart state on client side, to share fetched products & some globally needed boolean values across components.
- [Supabase] to maintain cart/user state on server side and to build auth.
- [directus] as a headless cms to build and maintain products-api by using a gui which directus provides us.
- [Formkit] to build easily maintainable forms.
- [VueUse-IntersectionObserver] to implement infinite scroll.
- [Aos] to build scroll reveal animations.




- I would handle buyouts with Stripe api or similar if it was a real world e-commerce.
- Gonna make "add to fav" button functional.
