# [Web App] Emaria
Fully functional general e-commerce website - https://emaria.vercel.app/
 

Techs used: Vue3, Nuxt3, Pinia, Supabase, directus, Formkit, Aos.
- [Vue3 & Nuxt3] as building blocks.
- [Pinia] to maintain cart state on client side, and to share fetched products across components.
- [Supabase] to maintain cart/user state on server side and to build auth.
- [directus] as a headless cms to build and maintain products-api by using a gui which directus provides for us.
- [Formkit] to build forms with ease.
- [Aos] to build scroll reveal animations.



Things to be added in order:
- Content is not responsive on mobile devices for now. Will add the feature soon.
- Shop ui will be redesigned.
- Buyouts will be handled with stripe api.
- Gonna make "add to fav" button functional.
